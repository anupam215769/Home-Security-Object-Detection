# SafeHome Observer
SafeHome Observer is a security-focused project that integrates YOLO-based object detection and BLIP image captioning to identify and describe persons or vehicles within camera feeds or recorded footage. Itâ€™s designed to help users monitor and keep track of critical events in real time, making it suitable for deployments in home or office security systems.
