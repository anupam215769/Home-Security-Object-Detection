# SafeHome Observer
SafeHome Observer is a security-focused project that integrates YOLO-based object detection and BLIP image captioning to identify and describe persons or vehicles within camera feeds or recorded footage. Itâ€™s designed to help users monitor and keep track of critical events in real time, making it suitable for deployments in home or office security systems.

## Working Behind

1. Lets you upload a video (e.g., `sample.mp4`).
2. Reads it frame-by-frame with `OpenCV` (sampling every N frames to reduce processing time).
3. Performs `YOLO1`2 object detection on each sampled frame (using the `Ultralytics` library).
4. Generates a caption for each sampled frame using a `VisionEncoderDecoderModel`.
5. Prints the detected objects and caption text in the `Streamlit` app.


> Important:
- This script can be resource-intensive for larger/longer videos (especially on CPU).
- For best performance, run on a system (or cloud environment) that has a GPU with the correct PyTorch version.
- By default, it attempts to use GPU. If no GPU is available, it falls back to CPU.
